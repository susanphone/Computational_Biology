String S and T
Scores G,L, and H
G for global Scores
L for semi-global Scores
    Use the smith-waterman algorithm or brute force
H for alignment with beginning space of S and ending space of T

Prove or Disprove the Statement $L \geq H \geq G$

In the book p41, we know the semi-global greater than global

S=ATCCGAACATCCAATCGAAGC
T=AGCATGCAT

ATCCGAACATCCAATCGAAGC
A---G--CATGCAAT------

global score = 6
semi-global score = 14
local score = 14
therefore this is true

The local score finds the longest common subsequence
semi-global adds a "-" at the end, so it's easy to align the strings
Global has to make it the same length using insertions and deletions,
and since the are more mismatches than matches,
global alignment scores lower that the others
