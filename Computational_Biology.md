* Cell, 
* DNA, RNA, Protein
* Genome, Chromosomes, Gene
* Central Dogma (from DNA to Protein)
* Mutation
* List of biotech tools
* Brief History of Bioinformatics

Body -> organs -> tissue -> cells

### Cell
    Performs two types of fuctions
        chem reactions
        pass info
    Actors:
        Protein -chem reaction
        DNA -  pass info
        RNA - intermediate between DNA and Proteins

### Protein
    Composed of 20 amino acids(20 letter alphabet)
        20 to 5000
        average is 350
    Folds into 3D shape, this forms the bulding block and performs most chem reactions within a cell
#### NP-Hard: Use a heuristic problem or solve smaller instances of that problem to solve the problem
    Polynomial time is P
    NP is Non-deterministic Polynomial
        Turing machines
    A <= B, A being NP and B being NP-Hard
    If you have a solution to B then you can solve for A
    The Intersection of NP-Hard and NP is NP-Complete
    NP-hard can be more challenging than NP
    P ?= NP
    P \subset NP

### Amino Acids
    4 types of amino acids

### DNA (ACTG)
* Adenine
* Guanine
* Thymine
* Cytosine
* Uracil - shows up in RNA T -> U

Double-stranded DNA is anti-parallel

Two types of organism
    prokaryotes - no nucleus
    eukaryotes - DNA in the nucleus

### Terms Related to DNA
* Genome - prokaryotes or eukaryotes
* Chromosomes - double helix strands
* Gene - Inside the chromosome. A program to construct a protein

### Gene
a sequence of DNA that encodes a protein or an RNA molecule
    IN prokaryotic genome, one gene corresponds to one protein
    In eukaryotic genome, one gene can correspond to more than one protein

Human Genome: 3G base pairs (eukaryotes)
Amoeba Genome: 670G base pairs (prokaryotes)

NOTE: Genome size has no relationship with the number of genes

### RNA
has both the properties of DNA and protein
    like DNA, it can store and transfer information
    like protein, it can form complex 3D structure and perform some functions

### Mutation
the change of genome by sudden
    Can cause cancer
    Basis of evolution

NOTE:can occur in DNA, RNA, and proteins

### Central Dogma
how we get the protein from the gene. Known as \u{Gene expession}
#### Transcription - DNA -> RNA
#### Translation - RNA -> protein
#### Modification done to the protein
    4 letter alphabet to 20 letter alphabet
        every three letters stands for one of the 20 letter alphabet
    Genetic code tables exist to decode this

### Problem: Find all occurrences of P in T
you have a very long string known as text (t)
a shorter string known as pattern (p)
    len(T) = n
    len(P) = m
