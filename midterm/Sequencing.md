# Basic Biotechniological Tools
## Cutting and Breaking DNA
* Restriction Enzymes:  recognizes certain point(restriction site) in the DNA with a particular pattern and break it. This is called **digestion**
    * Used to break foreign DNA to avoid infection.
    * More than 300 known restriction enzymes
        * EcoR1 is the first discovered that cuts DNA wherever the sequence GAATTC is found
    * Example:
        * Similar to most of the other restriction enzymes, GAATTC is a palindrome
    * EcoR1 is cut between G and A. **Sticky ends** are created
        * Note that some restriction enzymes give rise to **blunt ends** instead of sticky ends
* Shotgun Method: Break the DNA molecule into small pieces randomly
    * Method:
        * Have a solution having a large amount of purified ????      
## Copying DNA
### Cloning: small amounts of DNAs are not enough so we can clone by:
#### Cloning by Plasmid Vector: given a piece of DNA X, the cloning process is:
* see class notes
* easy to manipulate
#### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): 
* see class notes
1. heating dna to split strands
2. then add primers. 
3. Primers search for sticky ends. 
4. Replicate the strands using polymerase Taq. 
5. Repeat the process about 30 cycles.
* Examples:
    * Clone DNA fragments from mummies
    * detect viral infection

## Measuring length of DNA
### Gel Electrophoresis: get the length of dna pieces
* see notes
* An application of gel electtophoresis is to reconstruct dna sequence of length 500-800 within a few hours
* all fragments begin of the negative end and move to the positive end.
* Idea:
    * generating all sequences end with A
    * Using g.e. the sequence end with A are separated into different bands. Such information tells us the positions of A's in the sequence.
    * similar for C,G, and T
* you can group any length of string that has the common last letter

### Hybridization
* Look for a dna fragment that contains a particular DNA subsequence
1. suppose you need to find a DNA fragments which contains ACCGAT
2. create probes which inversely complementary to ACCGAT
3. mix the probes with the DNA fragments
4. due to hybridization rule (A=T, C=G), dna fragments which contain ACCGAT will hybridize with the probes.

### Applications of DNA arrays
* Sequencing by hybridization: alternative to g.e.
* Expression profile of cell: looking at DNA micro-arrays, and monitoring the activity within a cell
* Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection: single letter change is detected using a probe with different alleles.
* many more other applications!

## More advanced tools
* Mass Spectormetry
* SAGE, PET technology
* CRISPR/Cas9
