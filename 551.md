In the next month find a research project, partner project.
    Implementation algorith
    Interested in an unsolved problem
    Conferences: Algo {Recomb and wabi}  AI/bio {bcb and ismb}


Presentations are for partners

Farach linear time suffix tree
RNA sequence with network flows


## Farach's Suffix Tree
Come up with an engaging activity in creating a suffix tree
Linear time construction of a suffix tree
See slides for suffix tree from class

Farachs algorithm : linear time for general alphabet
Page 66(85)

Suffix Link: Lemma 3.1
1. build odd suffix tree
2. build even suffix tree
3. merge trees together

Powerpoint: step by step of building the suffix tree
Overleaf: everything else?

### Contents:
1. Time and Space Complexity
2. In depth of how each step works
3. Step by step process of example
4. Background
5. Applications
6. Suedo Code
